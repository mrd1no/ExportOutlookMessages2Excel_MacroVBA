This is my first github code. Please read before the readme.md file before using it. Before to use this macro, remember to:
1.change your permissions in MS Outlook,
2.update your username (C:\Users\"USERNAME"\...) - see row 29,
3. create a new MS Excel file and copy the directory - see row 31,
4. change the name of sheet where you want to paste the datas - see row 42,
5. open VBA in MS Outlook clicking Alt+F11 and createa new module where you will paste the following macro
